# README for CodeGrade Take-Home Exercises

## Overview

Welcome to the CodeGrade take-home exercises! This README provides an overview and instructions for two distinct exercises designed to evaluate your skills and approach in both front-end development and system design. These exercises are an opportunity to showcase your technical abilities, problem-solving skills, and creativity.

## Exercise 1: Front-End Development

### Goal

Develop a simple web application that allows users to post messages on a board, with each post having an expiry time. The focus is on implementing a front-end using Vue 3, TSX, and Pinia.

### Key Points

- The front-end should interact with a backend service (details provided separately).
- Each post should have an expiry time, after which it will no longer be displayed.

### Time Allocation

Spend no more than 5 hours on this task. Itâ€™s acceptable to submit an incomplete solution, but the application should be runnable.

### Location

This project can be found in the `coding` folder.

## Exercise 2: System Design

### Goal

Create a high-level design for redesigning CodeGrade's plagiarism detection system, currently based on JPlag. The new design should improve system performance and provide real-time feedback, while maintaining the accuracy of the current detection results.

### Key Points

- Focus on a high-level architectural design. No coding or implementation is required.
- Address system architecture, performance (excluding individual function optimization), scalability, reliability, and real-time feedback.
- Assume that individual functions (`Compare` and `Parse`) are optimized and not subject to modification.

### Time Allocation

Spend no more than 4 hours on this task. Submit a design document that effectively communicates your proposed architecture and approach.

## Submission Guidelines

- For each exercise, create a separate folder (`coding` for the development task and `design` for the system design task) in your repository/submission.
- Include all relevant files, code, diagrams, and documentation in the respective folders.
- Ensure that your submissions are clear, concise, and well-documented.

## Evaluation Criteria

- **Technical Proficiency**: Demonstrated ability in the relevant technologies and concepts.
- **Problem-Solving Skills**: Effectiveness in addressing the challenges presented in each exercise.
- **Communication**: Clarity and organization of your documentation and code.

We look forward to seeing your solutions and wish you the best of luck with these exercises!
